## Black_Window

A Linux tool that grabs exclusive control over keyboard and mouse input by displaying a fullscreen black window with a hidden mouse cursor. It also streams random data into named pipes in `/dev/shm/*.pipe` as part of its operation.

## üì¶ Installation


**Run the install script**:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   The script will:

   * Copy required files to your local app directory.
   * Prompt you for a SECRET key.
   * Create a `.desktop` launcher.
   * Install the required Python dependency (`python-xlib`).
   * Add Black Wind to your GNOME favorites.

## üßπ Uninstallation

**Run the uninstaller**:

   ```bash
   ./uninstall.sh
   ```

   This will:

   * Remove the app files and launcher.
   * Update the desktop environment.
   * Remove Black Wind from your GNOME favorites.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Linux system with GNOME desktop
* Python and `pip` installed
* `gnome-terminal` (used to run the app script)
* `python-xlib` (installed automatically)


---

## How It Works

* The Bash script detects dynamic named pipes in `/dev/shm` and launches background processes writing random data into these pipes.
* The Python script connects to the X server, grabs keyboard and mouse input exclusively, and creates a fullscreen black window with the mouse cursor hidden using Tkinter.
* Keyboard and mouse events are blocked from reaching other applications, effectively locking user input to this fullscreen window.
* When the window closes, input grabs are released, restoring normal system input behavior.
